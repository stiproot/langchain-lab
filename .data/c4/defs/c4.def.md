# C4 Diagrams

The four "C"s stand for the four levels of abstraction used to describe a software system:

Context: The highest level of abstraction, showing how the system interacts with its external users and other systems. It provides a big-picture view of the system and its relationships to the outside world.

Container: Zooms in on the system to show the high-level containers (such as web servers, databases, applications, microservices) that make up the system. It highlights how the containers interact with each other and their roles in the system.

Component: Focuses on the internal structure of individual containers. It shows how components within a container (such as classes, services, or modules) collaborate to fulfill the container's responsibilities.

Code (or Class) â€“ Optional: The lowest level of detail, typically a class diagram or source code-level view showing how the internal code works. It represents the fine-grained details of how components are implemented.
